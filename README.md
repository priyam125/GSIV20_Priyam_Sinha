A React App for browsing movies and getting info on particular movie.

1.  To run this app you need to clone the master branch and install the dependencies with npm install in the root folder.
2.  I feel like i have done well to implememt the fumctionalities in a short period of time as i just started working on it since saturday night. I have cretaed a global store with the help of redux to store the movielist array as it was used in multiple components. The search results are also very dynamic as you the results get rendered after you type each letter in the search bar . You can browser multiple pages of the movielist page as it includes pagination. I have also implemnted routing  to route to the individual movie description which redirects you to the info page. I have created the header component  seperately as it was reused in multiple components. The movielist page is also very responsive.
3.  If i had more time i would have definitely worked on the styling a bit more as my main focus was to implement the functionalities in the best possible way. With a few more time i could have divided the movielist page into seperate tabs for movies and tv series. I would have also liked to paginate the search results by moving the pagination info to the redux store.
